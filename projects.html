                        Once again, I got bored and wanted to work on something hands-on, this time I was getting into robotics and drones. I joined the Uni's newly minted drone team and participated in their first UAS Challenge entry.
                        We had a team that was quite skilled but relatively inexperienced. We decided to build a VTOL quadplane with a Carbon-fibre reinforced 3D printed airframe.

                    <h2>Project X</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a naive freshman in college, I was super bored with classes and was looking for something to work on hands-on.
                        I was travelling to college everyday on a scooter, and wanted to upgrade to a motorcycle. I wanted an electric one, but couldn't find one.
                        I decided to make my own. I drew up a few skecthes and specifications, and talked to a couple of friends about the project. 
                        They really liked it, and I realised other people might want one too, so I put together a team and started working on it.
                        I made the mistake of wanting to build all major components ourselves, but realised we were in way over our heads. I'm talking ground up power electronics desin like a 30KW AC motor controller, a 6kWh Li-ion Battery management board etc.

                        However, we managed to get support from the University as well as wiin some funds through a national competition.
                        In the meanwhile the year was ending and an opportunity for me to study at a University abroad came up that I couldn't pass up. So unfortunately I had to leave the project, but thankfully the team was still there!
                        The team ended up building a nice prototype and got some recognition for it. They eventually established an EV club at the University.
